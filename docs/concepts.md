# The Core Concepts of Repris

### Observations

An observation is a single measurement, such as the time taken to complete a task.

### Samplers

A sampler creates a specific kind of observation. For example, the stopwatch is a sampler that measures time intervals.

### Benchmarks

A benchmark brings together a function to run and a sampler to collect measurements. Each successful run of a benchmark generates one sample which is added to a trove.

### Samples

A sample is the set of observations generated by a sampler during a single benchmark run.

### Troves

A trove contains samples collected from multiple runs of a benchmark. The trove allows samples to be grouped together and analyzed as one, and two troves of the same benchmark can be compared to one another.

### Digests

A digest is a summary of the samples in a trove. The digest process repeatedly selects the best and rejects the worst samples, and over many runs this generates an accurate picture of the performance of a trove. Later, Repris can take two digests and compare them to identify changes in performance.

### Annotations

An annotation is a piece of meta-data associated with benchmarks, samples, troves etc. For example, the median of a sample is a statistic which in Repris is stored as an annotation of that sample. Annotations are usually used to present summary information in Repris reports.

### Index

The index is used to build an accurate snapshot of the performance of your project in its current state. This is similar to the git index where changes are stored before being committed to the repository. In Repris the index stores troves of all the benchmarks across your project.

The status of the index can be shown with the `show` command and cleared with the `reset` command.

### Snapshots

Repris snapshots are `.sample` files which capture the state of the index at a particular point in time. These can then be committed to your repository just like Jest `.snap` snapshot files.

Once the snapshot has been saved, you can use the `compare` command to look for changes in performance between the index and the snapshots.
